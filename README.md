(Cat) Camera Trap 
===============

Automatic camera trap to monitor the behaviour of our cats. Saves an image if movements are detected.
All images taken are automatically saved within a folder (named 'data') in the application directory.
Created with [Processing](https://www.processing.org) by Casey Reas and Ben Fry and a motion detection method discussed [here](https://forum.processing.org/two/discussion/4507/motion-detection).
